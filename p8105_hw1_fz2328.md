## Problem 1

Loading Dataset: The `penguins` dataset would be used for analysis in
this homework.

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

This dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. It includes 344 penguin
observations and describes their species, habitation islands, and
biological characteristics, such as flipper lengths, body mass, sex and
year. Their flipper length mean is 200.92 mm, and the bill length mean
is 43.92 mm.

Below is an overview of the first 10 rows of the `penguins` dataset that
we just loaded:

    ## # … with abbreviated variable names ¹​flipper_length_mm, ²​body_mass_g

Here we also have a summary for the 8 variables in this dataset:

We also made a scatterplot of their flipper length and bill length.

## Problem 2

-   First, we would use the following code to create a data frame named
    `Problem_2`comprised of:
    -   a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
    -   a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are
        greater than 0
    -   a character vector of length 10
    -   a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
Problem_2 = tibble(
                    random_sample = rnorm(10),
                    vec_log = random_sample > 0,
                    vec_char = "abc",
                    vec_factor = factor(c("a", "b", "c","a", "b", "c","a", "b", "c","a" )))
```

Now, try to take the mean of the four variables in `Problem_2` using the
following code, and outputs are also included:

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = random_sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.1742985

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_char)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_factor)): argument is not
    ## numeric or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The mean values were returned for the variables `random_sample` and
`vec_log` as -0.1742985 and 0.3, respectively. However, the mean
function did not work for the variables `var_char` and `var_factor`and
returned `NA`.

Then, Let’s try to apply the `as.numeric` function to the logical,
character and factor variables:

``` r
Problem_2$vec_log = as.numeric(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_log)) 
Problem_2$vec_char = as.numeric(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_char)) 
Problem_2$vec_factor = as.numeric(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_factor))
```

We can see that numerical values are assigned to the logical vector and
the factor vector, but `NAs` are assigned to the character vector.

Now, let’s try to take the mean for the logical, character and factor
variables again

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_log))
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(Problem_2, var = vec_factor))
```

    ## [1] 1.9

We can see that a same mean value of 0.3 is returned for the logical
vector as it was before applying the `as.numeric` function. A `NA` is
still returned for the character vector, which is also the same as
before. However, it is different for the factor variable `vec_factor`
that a mean value of 1.9 is returned after the applying the `as.numeric`
function.

This is because the logical variable has always been treated as a
numeric vector with 2 values. The factor variable has 3 level, so it
could be treated as numbers as well after applying the `as.numeric`
function. However, there is no way to convert the character variable to
numeric, so mean value could not be calculated for it all the time. This
also reflects that mean values could only be taken for those variables
which could be treated as numeric variables.
